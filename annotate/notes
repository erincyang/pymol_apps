add to pymolrc:

    (run script)
    ex.
    run /home/erinyang/scripts/pymol/annotate/annotate.py
    
    (set hotkeys - on my comp I have to press ctrl+hotkey I think so try that if it doesn't work)
    cmd.set_key('F10', annotate_bad)
    cmd.set_key('F12', annotate_good)

to use: select some part of object (ie. click random residue), press hotkey for good/bad
        writes name + 1 or 0 to file in directory called "annotate.txt"
